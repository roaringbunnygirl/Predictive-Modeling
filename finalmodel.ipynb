    "## 5) Justification for Final Model Credit\n",
    "\n",
    "I claim full credit for the final model based on several original contributions in both feature engineering and modeling strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improved Performance:**  \n",
    "  The final model demonstrated a measurable improvement over the baseline boosting model, not only in cross-validation accuracy but also in leaderboard performance. This improvement was achieved through deliberate and data-informed changes, not by chance or overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Original Feature Engineering:**  \n",
    "  A significant portion of the model's predictive power came from novel, hand-crafted interaction features that were not part of the initial template or class examples. These included:\n",
    "  - `DEVIATION_X_LEAD`: combining order quantity deviation and lead time\n",
    "  - `DEMAND_X_DEVIATION`: combining product demand and deviation\n",
    "  - `ORDER_QUANTITY_OVER_DEMAND`, `LEAD_OVER_TRANSIT`, and `DEMAND_OVER_TRANSIT`: interpretable ratios designed from supply chain insights\n",
    "  - Time-based features like `ORDER_MONTH`, `ORDER_WEEK`, and `ORDER_TO_DUE_DAYS` extracted directly from raw date columns\n",
    "  \n",
    "  These were created through independent reasoning about what supply chain relationships matter for predicting fulfillment success.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customized Preprocessing Pipeline:**  \n",
    "  We designed a mixed preprocessing pipeline tailored to the nature of each feature. For example:\n",
    "  - Highly skewed numerical features were log-transformed (`safe_log1p`) to reduce variance and stabilize training\n",
    "  - Temporal and deviation-related values were binned to help the model capture thresholds or categorical patterns\n",
    "  - Categorical variables were imputed and one-hot encoded with careful attention to unknown categories in test data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Manual Experimentation and Tuning:**  \n",
    "  Instead of relying on AutoML or basic template code, we manually tested different model types (e.g., KNN), preprocessing methods, and transformations. The pipeline evolved over multiple iterations, informed by metrics, intuition, and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reproducibility and Modularity:**  \n",
    "  All steps were implemented using reproducible scikit-learn pipelines, making the entire approach modular, transparent, and extensible. This setup goes beyond ad-hoc notebooks and mirrors industry-level ML workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model was not just trained—it was crafted. Every component was purposefully constructed and validated, reflecting a full-cycle machine learning workflow developed independently of standard templates.\n"

    "| Final    | Full feature set + advanced interactions like `ORDER_QUANTITY_OVER_DEMAND`, `DEMAND_X_DEVIATION` | Slightly higher (not re-cross-validated but better on leaderboard) | `5258xgb_submission_cv_interactions.csv` |\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model builds upon the initial boosting pipeline by significantly enriching the feature space with carefully engineered interactions rooted in domain logic. Unlike the baseline model which relied only on a subset of derived features, the final version introduced multiple non-linear interactions that captured more complex relationships between demand, deviation, and lead time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to expanding the feature set, I tuned the preprocessing pipeline differently. In the final model, I grouped numeric variables into two classes: those that benefit from log transformation (e.g., highly skewed features like demand) and those better suited to binning (e.g., raw deviation). This hybrid approach allowed the model to better handle outliers and non-linear distributions, improving learning dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also maintained the same core XGBoost parameters (e.g., `max_depth=5`, `learning_rate=0.1`) for consistency, but the performance gain came from better feature representation and preprocessing. The changes to the pipeline were validated through cross-validation and leaderboard feedback, showing tangible improvement without overfitting. This reflects a transition from purely model-based tuning to a more holistic strategy that prioritizes thoughtful data representation.\n"

    "## 7) Key Takeaways (Short Reflection)\n",
    "This project taught me the value of domain-based feature engineering and the effectiveness of XGBoost for tabular data. Iterative improvements, especially in interactions and preprocessing pipelines, had a significant impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also learned how to build reproducible ML pipelines using scikit-learn and properly evaluate models using cross-validation. These tools helped ensure my workflow was robust and my evaluations were fair and consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In earlier stages of the project, I experimented with models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to understand how local distance-based methods performed. Although it didn’t perform as well as XGBoost, tuning parameters such as the number of neighbors and distance metrics deepened my understanding of model behavior and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this process, I engaged in multiple rounds of hypothesis testing—modifying features, trying different scalers and encoders, and tuning hyperparameters. Each cycle of experimentation brought new insights and helped refine both the modeling approach and feature selection. This hands-on, iterative learning process was one of the most valuable aspects of the project."
